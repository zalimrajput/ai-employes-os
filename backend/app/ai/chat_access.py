"""Department-level access control for AI chat.

Every org member used to see every org conversation. This module scopes chat to
departments: a user sees their own conversations plus conversations with the AI
employees of their department (Sales users <-> AI Sales Assistant, Finance <-> AI
Finance Assistant / AI Accountant, ...). Company admins and platform super admins
see everything.

Mirrors the frontend mapping in frontend/src/lib/agents.ts (ROLE_TO_AGENT).
